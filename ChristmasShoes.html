Mixing Bowls
Baking Sheet
Silicone Mat
Cookie Scoop
Cooling Rack
INGREDIENTS
15.25 ounces red velvet cake mix (1 box)
⅓ cup vegetable oil
2 large eggs
1 cup red, white & blue M&Ms
½ cup granulated sugar for coating
INSTRUCTIONS
Add the cake mix, vegetable oil, and eggs to a large bowl or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and beat until combined.
Fold in half of the M&M’s.
Chill the dough for 60 minutes. Do not skip this step!
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
Use a medium cookie scoop to portion out the dough and gently roll into balls. Then roll the balls in the sugar to coat. Place the balls of dough on the prepared baking sheet at least 2 inches apart.
Bake for 8 to 9 minutes. Do not over bake these cookies, they will look puffy and slightly underdone, but they will finish cooking on the baking sheet after coming out of the oven.
Press the M&M’s into the tops of the cookies right after they come out of the oven, then let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

  <section> It was almost Christmas time, there I stood in another line
Tryin' to buy that last gift or two, not really in the Christmas mood
Standing right in front of me was a little boy waiting anxiously
Pacing 'round like little boys do
And in his hands he held a pair of shoes
    <hr>
  </section>
His clothes were worn and old, he was dirty from head to toe
And when it came his time to pay
I couldn't believe what I heard him say
<section>
Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my mama, please
It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry, sir, daddy says there's not much time
You see she's been sick for quite a while
And I know these shoes would make her smile
And I want her to look beautiful if mama meets Jesus tonight
</section>

He counted pennies for what seemed like years
Then the cashier said, "son, there's not enough here"
He searched his pockets frantically
Then he turned and he looked at me
He said mama made Christmas good at our house
Though most years she just did without
Tell me Sir, what am I going to do,
Somehow I've got to buy her these Christmas shoes

So I laid the money down, I just had to help him out
And I'll never forget the look on his face when he said
Mama's gonna look so great

Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my mama, please
It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry, sir, daddy says there's not much time
You see she's been sick for quite a while
And I know these shoes would make her smile
And I want her to look beautiful if mama meets Jesus tonight
<section>
I knew I'd caught a glimpse of heaven's love
As he thanked me and ran out
I knew that God had sent that little boy
To remind me just what Christmas is all about

Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my mama, please
It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry, sir, daddy says there's not much time
You see she's been sick for quite a while
And I know these shoes would make her smile
And I want her to look beautiful if mama meets Jesus tonight
I want 'er to look beautiful if mama meets Jesus tonight
