In a world that she can't rise above

<em>The child's doctor can explain children's needs at every age. He or she can recommend places to learn more about parenting and child care.
Local health and social service departments often have parenting classes. Social service workers also can help parents get assistance to ease their financial situations.
Hospitals and community centers often have classes on stress reduction, parenting, discipline, and nutrition.
Psychologists, counselors, and social workers can help parents and caregivers deal with problems like drug use, anger and previous experiences of abuse.
Religious groups often provide food, counseling, and other types of support for anyone in the communityâ€”not just their members. </em>
